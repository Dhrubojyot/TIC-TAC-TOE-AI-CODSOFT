# TIC-TAC-TOE-AI-CODSOFT
Its an an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. I uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play strategically against the human player, And for the Computer Graphics I used the Pygame module to design the game and make it more attractive for the users to play.
